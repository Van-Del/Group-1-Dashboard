# Information Functions
It provides information about the content, formatting and location of cells in an Excel Worksheet.
- Iseven (ISEVEN): it will return TRUE if the number is even or FALSE if the number is not even, or odd.

- Isodd (ISODD): it returns TRUE if the number is odd or FALSE if the number is even.

- Isblank (ISBLANK): it checks whether a cell is blank or not.

- Istext (ISTEXT): this function will test if a given value is a text string or not.

- Isnontext (ISNONTEXT): this function helps to check if a cell contains text or not (is anything typed into a cell?).

# Lookup Functions 
It is used to search for a specific value in a range or table of data and return related information from that range. These functions are extremely useful for tasks such as finding corresponding values, performing approximate matches, and retrieving data from large datasets.
- Lookup (LOOKUP): is used for looking through a single column or row to find a particular value from the same place in a second column or row.

- Match (MATCH): it searches for a specified item in a range of cells, and then returns the relative position of that item in the range.

- Vlookup (VLOOKUP): is a built-in Excel function used to search for a value in the first column of a table range and return a corresponding value from another column in the same row.

- Hlookup (HLOOKUP): is used to search for a value in the top row of an array of values, and then it retrieves the value in the same column from a row you specify in the table or array.

- Address (ADDRESS): it returns the absolute address of the cell based on a specified row and column number.
